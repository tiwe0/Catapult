"tip_os_hopping","You can bring the Catapult folder from Windows to Linux (or vice versa) and keep using it, but you will have to download the correct Catapult executable and update your game at least once."
"tip_dual_install","Both [i]C:DDA[/i] and [i]C:BN[/i] can be installed at the same time. Their installations are completely independent, and their updates, mods and soundpacks are managed separately."
"tip_downgrading","You can downgrade your game version by choosing to \""update\"" to an earlier build, but beware of save compatibility issues."
"tip_stock_mods","Mods that come with the game are not managed by Catapult (except for preventing them from being installed a second time). Catapult only deals with the [i]/mods[/i] folder, not [i]/data/mods[/i]."
"tip_mod_multi_install","You can select multiple mods to install/delete by [i]Ctrl-clicking[/i] and [i]Shift-clicking[/i] in the lists."
"tip_modpack_update","Kenan's Modpack is updated quite often. Just click [i]Get Kenan Modpack[/i] again to re-download it and replace the mods in your local repository."
"tip_debug_mode","Getting unhelpful error messages? Try enabling debug mode under [i]Settings[/i] for more verbose output."
"tip_bug_reporting","If you're having an issue with the launcher and don't see it already reported [color=#3b93f7][url=https://github.com/qrrk/Catapult/issues]on GitHub[/url][/color], then you may well be the first person to notice it! Consider creating a ticket for it, if you have a GitHub account."
"tip_backup_caveat","If you keep multiple worlds in your game, beware that savegame backups always operate on the entire save DirAccess. This means that when a backup is restored, all previous contents of the save directory are lost (including any worlds that weren't in this backup)."
"tip_multi_install","You can now have multiple versions of the game installed at the same time and easily switch between them. However, saves and other user data are shared between installs, so beware of breakages or corruption when switching between too-dissimilar versions (e.g. stable and experimental)."
